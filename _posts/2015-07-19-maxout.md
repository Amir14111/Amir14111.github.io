Researching for my master thesis I tried to understand the paper by Goodfellow 
et al. on the *Maxout Units*. I found it very hard understanding the details
and thought a clear explanation in combination with a nice figure would be 
really helpful. So this is my shot at doing so.

__Please note, that everything explaned here was not developed by me, but is
just an explanation of the [paper by Goodfellow et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4389)__

### Key infos about *Maxout*

- *Maxout* is an __activation function__
- supposed to be __combined with *dropout*__
- that __minimizes__ the model averaging __approximation error__ when using dropout
- is a __piecewise linear__ approximation to an arbitrary convex function


$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{n,m}^{l}\left(x,\, y\right)} = \sum_{x',y'} o_{n}^{l-1}\left( x'-x,\, y' - y \right) \cdot \delta_{m}^{l}\left(x',\, y' \right)
$$



$$
\delta_{m}^{l}\left(x,\: y\right)=\frac{\partial E}{\partial c_{m}^{l}\left(x,\, y\right)}=\sum_{o}\sum_{\, x',\, y'}^{N_{w},N_{w}}\underbrace{\frac{\partial E}{\partial c_{o}^{l+1}\left(x+x',\, y+y'\right)}}_{\delta_{o}^{l+1}\left(x+x',\, y+y'\right)}\cdot\frac{\partial c_{o}^{l+1}\left(x+x',\, y+y'\right)}{\partial c_{m}^{l}\left(x,\, y\right)}
$$
